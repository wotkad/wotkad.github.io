      <h2>Welcome everyone!</h2>
      <p>As you all know, there have been a significant amount of recent global changes that are going to have an everyday impact on how we conduct our business activities.</p>
      <p>And as a result, we’ve decided to put this training program together, so that we are all fully informed (or as informed as we possibly can be), regarding the newly introduced Price Cap Rules -</p>
      <p>We know or even expect these rules to change with little notice - but to the best of our knowledge, the information that we are providing you with today is correct.</p>
      <p>These are the rules that (for the foreseeable future), are going to affect how we operate as an organisation.</p>
      <p>So, the main purpose of this training is to provide as much information as we possible can to all LITASCO group personnel, contractors and our agents.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="1">
      <p>Although we want each of you to fully be on board with the changes that we are having to make…</p>
      <p>We want to make it very clear that this is for internal compliance training purpose only and it does not constitute legal opinion on behalf of LITASCO or anyone that we do business with.</p>
      <p>And as reminder, please keep the content of this course confidential and avoid any disclosure to any third party.</p>
      <p>So, as long as no one has any questions at this point, you can go ahead, press start and we can get going…</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="2">
      <p>So, whilst we are going to be spending some time summarising the Price Cap Rules, let us to reiterate again that this is the information that we have right now.</p>
      <p>Although it might feel that we are currently working towards a moving target… (which we appreciate is not a great position to be in - we are all having to adapt to the new conditions of our industry).</p>
      <p>So… the current plan is to monitor the situation very closely and if rules are changed, our training content and compliance policies will be amended accordingly and the new information will be shared internally as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>We promise to keep you up date as much as possible, which in turn will hopefully mean that there will be minimal disruption to your daily workload.</p>
      <p>So as we progress from the summary of the Price Cap Rules, we will move onto:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>• Overview of the Price Cap Rules and enforcement requirements,</li>
        <li>• then on to LITASCO compliance requirements on unconventional projects,</li>
        <li>• the possible implications of non-compliance,</li>
        <li>• the sanctions that have been implemented by Russia,</li>
        <li>• and finally we will look at an overview of reporting requirements and the support we have here at LITASCO.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If at any point you find that you have any additional questions or queries, or if there is something that is not 100% clear, then please refer to the latest version of LITASCO Compliance Operational Guidance available on the company’s internal portal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="3">
      <p>We are fully aware that the introduction of the 2022 Price Cap rules poses a number of specific challenges, however as an organisation we believe that they can be not only managed, but we also believe that we can secure our business continuity via our compliance measures, which can be our competitive advantage, until which point the sanctions will be lifted and we can return to full trading capacity.</p>
      <p>Until this point, it remains imperative that we showcase full compliance to ensure future successes. Therefore it is mandatory that we accept and apply all Price cap Rules to all of our business transactions as applicable.</p>
      <p>How it started…</p>
      <p>The Price Cap Rules were implemented initially by G7 countries, namely:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>• the United States,</li>
        <li>• the United Kingdom,</li>
        <li>• Canada,</li>
        <li>• France,</li>
        <li>• Germany,</li>
        <li>• Italy,</li>
        <li>• and Japan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the European Union (EU), Australia, Switzerland and the European Economic Area (EEA), following suit.</p>
      <p>This collective is now referred to as G7+ countries.</p>
      <p>All persons from these aforementioned jurisdictions combined are prohibited from partaking in any activities or aiding any transactions with Russian oil or petroleum products - Unless they are sold at, or below the specified Price Cap.</p>
      <p>Whilst the legalities are very similar across all G7+ countries, there will be some differences, so therefore it’s going to instil greater confidence to confirm the exacting rules by country, rather than expecting the laws to automatically be the same.</p>
      <p>However, whilst it is important to understand the legislation of each country, our main focus will generally be on the US, the EU and the UK, as these jurisdictions are mostly applicable in the interest of our stakeholders in the international oil trade and maritime shipping business, and therefore is our greatest challenge.</p>
      <p>Detailed information and rules has been published in the ‘Guidelines’ by each jurisdiction and are available here by the links. The guidelines have been made clear, transparent and explicit by the countries that expect the Price Cap Rules to be applied to all transactions and the required authentications to showcase 100% compliancy.</p>
      <p>This summary of the Guidelines is also accessible in the LITASCO Compliance Operational Guidance in order for all operations to be completed in accordance with the relevant laws.</p>
      <p>The following are mandatory considerations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>• Every trade deal</li>
        <li>• All import/export operations</li>
        <li>• All services and transactions</li>
        <li>• All necessary approvals and notifications (including approvals from local or other State authorities, if required).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is this level of detail of compliance that is imperative for the continuation of not only our international trade, but also of our continued successes in the future, all of which we want you to be part of.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="4">
      <p class="aside-el-4-1">The Price Cap Rules ONLY apply to individuals and companies that fall under the laws of G7+ countries.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-4-1">However, it is not quite that straightforward as the definition of exactly who the jurisdiction applies to is dependent on each specific country.</p>
      <h2 class="aside-el-4-1">The following is a breakdown of who has to apply the Price Cap Rules by country:</h2>
      <ul class="aside-el-4-1">
        <li>• US - US citizens wherever located, or U.S. green card holders, wherever located, or anybody physically located in the U.S., or any person who is paid by a U.S. entity, or US based companies or an overseas branch. <br><br></li>
        <li>• EU - citizens of EU member states wherever located or anyone physically located in the EU, or anyone paid by an EU entity or its overseas branch, or EU based companies or an overseas branch. <br><br></li>
        <li>• UK - UK citizens wherever located or anyone physically located in the UK, or anyone paid by an UK entity or its overseas branch, or UK based companies or an overseas branch. <br><br></li>
        <li>• Australia - citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia wherever located or anyone physically located in Australia, or anyone paid by an Australian entity or its overseas branch, or AU based companies or an overseas branch. <br><br></li>
        <li>• Canada - citizens of Canada wherever located or anyone physically located in Canada, or anyone paid by a Canadian entity or its overseas branch, or Canadian based companies or an overseas branch. <br><br></li>
        <li>• EEA - citizens of European Economic Association (Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Norway) member states wherever located or anyone physically located in the EEA member state, or anyone paid by an EEA entity or it’s overseas branch, or EEA based companies or its overseas branches. <br><br></li>
        <li>• Swiss citizens who reside and are employed overseas are exempt from the jurisdiction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="faded aside-el-4-2">Whilst we must ensure that we are fully compliant with the laws of G7+ countries as applicable, it is also important to note that all individuals and companies that do not fall under the jurisdiction of any G7+ countries do not have to comply with the Price Cap Rules and are free to trade and to brokers services as they have always done.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-4-2">Trade deals and transactions, with individuals and companies not under G7+ jurisdiction are not required to comply with Price Cap Rules.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-4-2">However, if any G7+ persons are involved in any aspect of our business, the Price Cap Rules must be applied.</p>
      <h2 class="faded aside-el-4-2">This includes:</h2>
      <p class="faded aside-el-4-2">Trading and/or Maritime transportation (or associated services),including brokering, financing, financial assistance, shipping, insurance, flagging and technical assistance (does not include vessel or cargo testing, inspection or certification services).</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-4-2">It is important to once again note that any persons or organisations that fall under G7+ legislation are unable to provide maritime transportation (or associated services) that aids the movement of Russian oil or any oil related products from Russia to a third country unless the price is above the Cap.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="5">
      <p class="aside-el-5-1">So now that we have established what the rules are, we now need to gain an understanding of how it is computed.</p>
      <h2 class="aside-el-5-1">The current caps stand as follows:</h2>
      <p class="aside-el-5-1">Crude Oil is US$60 per barrel.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-5-1">Products traded at a Premium to Crude is US$100 per barrel. It can be noted that Premium to Crude products include gasoline, motor spirits, aviation spirits, motor fuel blend stocks, gasohol, diesel fuel, kerosene, kerosene-type jet fuel, and vacuum gas oil).</p>
      <p class="aside-el-5-1">Products traded at a discount to crude is US$45 per barrel. Discount to crude products include, residual fuel oils, naphtha, and waste oils.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-5-1">And once again, this is how the figures are calculated as of today, but remain subject to change at the discretion of member of G7+ coalition. If changes to the price caps do occur, we believe that there will be a reasonable notice period to allow us time to make the necessary changes to adhere to the new rules.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-5-1">For more information or to confirm the current price caps, please refer to the resources available on the intranet.</p>
      <h2 class="faded aside-el-5-2">It is important to distinguish exactly what is included in the Price Cap.</h2>
      <p class="faded aside-el-5-2">As of this moment the unit price of oil per barrel (CN 2709) and the unit price of oil products per barrel (CN 2710) are being capped by G7+ countries.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-5-2">Other costs such as shipping, freight, customs and insurance are currently not subject to the price cap rules and remain at the FOB (free on board) price.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-5-2">This is where it becomes vital that the distinction is made.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-5-2">Trading contracts must be transparent, clearly showcasing the price per barrel at the ‘capped’ rates and the ‘other’ or ancillary costs must be listed and invoiced separately from the unit prices.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-5-2">This is to ensure that we are offering services at fair market value and not increasing the cost to offset the losses being incurred due to the Price Cap Rules.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-5-2">The following example of two Deals shows how costs differentiators effecting on the final price and make one cargo in line with the Price Cap (which we call internally as Conventional) and another, where the final price on cargo exceeds the Price Cap (which we call internally as Unconventional).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="6">
      <p>When does the Price Cap start?</p>
      <p>This is a very important question, that has a surprisingly simple answer.</p>
      <p>‘The Price Cap Rules are applicable from the exact moment that the cargo is loaded on board a vessel’. And this is the case for all transactions.</p>
      <p>The price cap applies to all transactions until such time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>• When the cargo has cleared customs and landed at its destination (outside of Russia). <br><br></li>
        <li>• When Russian crude oil (CN/HS 2709) is transformed into a product that has a different code. <br><br></li>
        <li>• Or when Russian petroleum products (CN/HS 2710) undergo substantial processing through a blending operation in a third country with non-Russian origin product(s) and results in a change to the output coding.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, this is a slightly grey area which is under the attention of regulators and of the industry, because if the cargo is re-exported out by sea again, without significant transformation, the Price Cap Rules need to be reapplied, irregardless of completing the initial shipment. And the same notion is applied if after landing in a third country, the oil is re-loaded onto a vessel without having undergone an economically justified substantial transformation, it is again subject to the price cap.</p>
      <p>Yet, despite these situations where the price cap stops being applicable, it is imperative to note that even if CN/HS 2709 or 2710 has been subject to substantial transformation or blending process, it is still prohibited to sell, transport, import or supply the resulting product(s) into any country (убираем из записи territory) that has made illegal the sale, transport, import or supply of Russian oil products in the first instance, namely G7+ countries, e.g. prohibition to bring Russian oil into the UK, US or into the EU.</p>
      <p>In addition to above, we need to careful on co-mingling operations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="7">
      <h2>Before we continue, let’s have a brief review of the key points that we have already covered so far.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>• The Price Cap Rules ONLY apply to persons who reside, work or is affiliated with G7+ countries who are involved in the maritime transportation and associated services of Russian oil or oil products moving from Russia to third countries. <br><br></li>
        <li>• Price Cap compliance is mandatory when persons with G7+ status are involved. <br><br></li>
        <li>• If all Price Cap compliance has occurred, we will need to provide and retain all relevant documentary evidence. <br><br></li>
        <li>• Price Cap Rules take effect the moment Russia oil or products are loaded onto the vessel and they seize once the cargo has landed in a third country (and not re-exported by sea), or has been substantially transformed and a coding change has occurred. <br><br></li>
        <li>• All G7+ persons are strictly prohibited from any transactions regarding all Russian oil or oil products that are being traded above the enforced Price Cap.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is important to retain the information from these five points and they are the very basics of understanding of how we need to alter our transactions and all of our dealing with G7+ persons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="8">
      <h2>Let’s talk enforcement.</h2>
      <p>We have already established that compliance regarding Price Cap Rules is mandatory but what we haven’t considered yet, is how it is actually being enforced within G7+ countries.</p>
      <p>Price Cap Rules established a Three-Tiered system to classify actors involved in maritime transportation or associated services dependent on the nature of their involvement within the transaction and their knowledge of the price of oil.</p>
      <p>Actors involved in trading or maritime transportation, or associated services to facilitate the movement of Russian oil or products from Russia to any third country, if they have status of G7+ persons have different obligations on retention of price information, retention and its provision to other actors, and reporting obligations as applicable.</p>
      <p>For ease of understanding, Tier 1 actors have full knowledge of the price of oil, as well as direct involvement in Russian oil or oil related products, and Tier 3 actors have no direct access to pricing information.</p>
      <p>But let’s look at the three tiers in detail, so we can have a better understanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="9">
      <h2>Tier 1 actors are the parties with direct access to price information.</h2>
      <p>Examples of Tier 1 individuals are: <br> Commodity brokers <br> Oil Traders <br> and Importers</p>
      <p>Tier 1 actors are required to retain all price information, including: <br> Invoices <br> Contracts <br> Receipts/proof of payments</p>
      <p>This documentation can be shared with both Tier 2 and 3 organisations on request, when it is relevant.</p>
      <p>Again, for your use the approved wording for LITASCO attestations is available in the Compliance Operational Guidance. Use of the approved wording will not only make the work easier, it should be employed for consistency across our company.</p>
      <p>In addition, there are a number of requirements imposed by the Price Cap Rules and they are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>• Russian Oil and oil products must be sold at, or below the Price Cap and this must be documented.</li>
        <li>• This documentation must be retained for a minimum of 5 years after the seaborne transportation has occurred.</li>
        <li>• There needs to be transparent sharing of information when requested, that clearly evidences compliance of Price Cap Rules.</li>
        <li>• The UK has slightly different rules than it’s G7+ counterparts, in that all UK Tier 1 actors must report directly to the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), which is a part of HM Treasury to confirm that all sales have been made at, or below the Price Cap.</li>
        <li>• The UK also requires any potential offences made under the rules to be reported by UK persons to OFSI as part of the chain of co</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As the UK has different requirements we have outlined them for you in the following table.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="10">
      <h2>Following on through the Tiers, we will look at the Tier 2 actors next.</h2>
      <p>People or organisations that fall under Tier 2 are those that have direct dealings with Tier 1 actors, but do not have direct and consistent access to price information.</p>
      <p>Examples of Tier 2 individuals are: <br> Financial institutions <br> shipping companies</p>
      <p>Tier 2 parties are required to request and retain all price information, including: <br> Invoices <br> Contracts <br> and receipts or other proof of payment</p>
      <p>In addition, they will need to obtain relevant documentation from their Tier 1 counterparts and well as proof that their counterparts are also acting within the legal guidelines of the Price Cap Rules.</p>
      <p>Approved wording for LITASCO attestations is available in the Compliance Operational Guidance and is available for any employee that requires the information. The approved wordings should not be amended or altered in any way in order to retain consistency throughout our organisation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="11">
      <h2>The final tier, Tier 3 concern parties that have no direct access to price information.</h2>
      <p>Examples of Tier 3 Actors are: <br> Ship owners <br> Ship management companies <br> Insurers <br> Cargo, P&I, H&M, reinsurers or insurance brokers <br> and flagging registries</p>
      <p>They are required to confirm that their counterparts from Tiers 1 and 2 are fully compliant with the Price Cap Rules. This can be obtained either with each transaction or as part of policy or contractual documentation that confirms and covers all compliance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="12">
      <p>The UK makes it personal - any UK person that falls under the UK Price Cap Rules has a personal responsibility to report any activities that are not in line with the legislation. They are required to inform OFSI as soon as they become aware of a potential violation.</p>
      <p>Again, for your use the approved wording for LITASCO attestations is available in the Compliance Operational Guidance. Use of the approved wording will not only make the work easier, it should be employed for consistency across our company.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="13">
      <p>As an organisation, we do not have to report directly to OFSI however, UK nationals working for LITASCO are obligated to do so. Meaning that each time a UK national was involved in transactions with Russian origin cargos or believes that they have undertaken, or have been asked to undertake a prohibited activity they must directly contact OFSI in line with its Industry Guidance on UK Maritime Services Ban and Oil Price Cap.</p>
      <p>In order to keep inconvenience to a minimum for our UK national employees, LITASCO companies have suggested that we will carry out this reporting obligation, with individual consent.</p>
      <p>If you are a UK national and would like more information, please contact the Compliance team.</p>
      <p>As an additional factor, LITASCO companies have introduced corporate whistle-blowing policy that allows all employees the opportunity to make an internal report if they feel full compliancy is not being met - this is available on the company’s intranet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="14">
      <h2 class="aside-el-14-1"><i>(If you have the status of G7+ person, you can skip this chapter of the course).</i></h2>
      <p class="aside-el-14-1">In review, we know the Price Cap Rules apply to G7+ persons. We know that we must operate with full compliance, with all applicable laws and contractual obligations.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-14-1">On the other hand we also know that compliance, full understanding of the laws and obligations still apply to projects that are not subject to Price Cap Rules, known as Unconventional Projects.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-14-1">With that in mind let’s explore the key compliance principles of unconventional projects.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-14-1">For optimum preparation and delivery of unconventional projects we will need to consider all the points in the following list. They are:</p>
      <ul class="aside-el-14-1">
        <li>•Due Diligence of Resources</li>
        <li>•Control of Engagements</li>
        <li>•Due Diligence and Approvals</li>
        <li>•Concise Instructions and Communications</li>
        <li>•Compliance in Performance</li>
        <li>•Record Retention and Audits</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="aside-el-14-1">We also need to consider the order in which we complete the key steps required for compliant performance. We suggest the following plan as to how Unconventional Projects should be approached with the following steps.</p>
      <h2 class="aside-el-14-1">They are:</h2>
      <p class="aside-el-14-1">(1) ensuring the projects are pre-reviewed by Trading Department, Operations, Finance with support of Compliance Department <br> (2) have proper compliance risks management and business continuity assurance, <br> (3) are approved by relevant LME management</p>
      <p class="aside-el-14-1">It should also be noted that LITASCO business partners must form their own independent views concerning appropriate compliance policies in accordance with the Price Cap Rules.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-2">Any individual under the jurisdiction of a G7+ country cannot be involved in any transactions involving Russian Oil and/or petroleum products that are not sold at or below the relevant Price Cap.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-2">Therefore any unconventional projects cannot have any involvement from a G7+ person.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-2">As a result and because of our commitment to compliance at LITASCO, we want full transparency on all of projects, we will be documenting all persons on Unconventional Projects to ensure that no G7+ persons have any involvement.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-2">If any G7+ employee is unclear on whether they are being asked to partake in any unconventional work, they should confirm the true nature of the project before proceeding any further. This will prevent any disparities in our continued compliance.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-3">Another key process that needs to be considered during unconventional projects is the approved payment process. Any G7+ persons, e.g. employees or banks, must not have any involvement in payments or financial services when the oil or products have been traded above the applicable Price Cap.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-3">It remains possible that Unconventional Projects can be quoted in G7+ currencies, but the financial transaction itself has to be conducted in a non-G7+ currency.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-3">This is another area that we will continue to monitor through our Treasury Department in order to confirm total compliance.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">Now we all know that all unconventional projects must comply with all applicable restrictions, but what else needs to be done?</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">Well, you’ll be pleased to know that there is a lot that needs to be done.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">You will need to consider the following:</p>
      <ul class="faded aside-el-14-4">

      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">We also highly recommend using the RACI matrix to correctly identify which stakeholder is responsible for each element of the project.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">This will help with successful preparation, execution and finally, completion.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">The projects are dependent on teamwork and having an excellent understanding of who has responsibility and accountability will make the team stronger from the outset, and better foundations to ensure the success of the overall project.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">This is why we advise that the RACI matrix is employed at the very start of each project to ensure that all applicable activities are properly arranged, maintained and controlled by each respective stakeholder.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">We are looking to strive for: <br> 1. planning to begin <br> 2. identifying the workload <br> 3. assigning accountability <br> 4. execution <br> 5. completion <br> 6. success</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">To fully explain why this part of the process is so important, we need to explore what the potential repercussions could be if incorrect assignment of stakeholder duties or any deviation from the RACI occurs.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">It could lead to non-compliance with the Price Cap Rules.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">It could result in not following the LME Compliance Operational Guidance.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">Both of which would result in more serious implications including disciplinary action or termination of employment. It could affect the contract, which could lead to loss of clients, which is obviously bad for business and our business reputation.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">And right at the top of the spectrum, obviously depending on the severity of the error, but it could result in official investigations which in turn, can result in financial penalties, legal prosecution and loss of business license.</p>
      <p class="faded aside-el-14-4">This is why it is imperative that the RACI matrix is employed at the beginning of a project, correctly implemented and mistakes prevented.</p>

    <div class="aside__note" data-id="15">
      <p>The oil industry today is focused as much on compliancy, as it is on trading. Therefore there are as many resources and people involved in the monitoring of compliance, as there are involved in the trade and movement of goods.</p>
      <p>In addition to the standard compliance, G7+ members have enforced Price Cap Rules in their own countries as well as everywhere we G7+persons are involved.</p>
      <p>Non-compliance with the Price Cap Rules or deviations from the LME Compliance Operational Guidance could result in any of the negative implications we have just discussed in the last chapter.</p>
      <p>All our work needs to take the Price Cap Rules into consideration at every step of the project to ensure its success.</p>
      <p>For any queries or if you need more up to date information, you should refer to the LITASCO Compliance Operational Guidance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="16">
      <p>We next need to quickly look at sanctions that have been imposed by Russian Federation in regards to all crude oil and petroleum products.</p>
      <p>As of the 1st of June 2019 any supplies of Russian Crude Oil and Petroleum Products to Ukraine is prohibited.</p>
      <p>And as a result, we at LITASCO are not permitted to export any goods to Ukraine, in line with existing contractual obligations as outlined by our Russian suppliers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="17">
      <p class="aside-el-17-1">Now we need to explore the Russian Federation response to the implementation of the Price Cap Rules imposed by the G7+ countries.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-17-1">Russian Federation responded by issuing a ban on the supply of Russian oil and petroleum products to any foreign party, where the contracts contain instructions to amend the marginal price in line with the G7+ Price Cap Rules.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-17-1">This ban can only be overturned by special request and only at the discretion of the President of Russia.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-17-1">As per Russian Presidential Decree No. 317 on the 28th April 28 2023 (amending Decree No. 961), states that; supplies of Russian oil pursuant to the international agreements of the Russian Federation entered before the effective date of the Decree, can only be honoured where the final destination is a ‘friendly’ state, and does not feature on the Russian government approved ‘unfriendly’ list.</p>
      <p class="aside-el-17-2 faded">So, as a direct result of the changing laws in Russia, Russian exporters/suppliers are obligated to do the following:</p>
      <ul class="aside-el-17-2 faded">
        <li>• ensure that there are no mechanisms for fixing the marginal price (whilst still taking into account sanctions in contracts)</li>
        <li>• ensure monitoring of the non-application of the mechanism for fixing the marginal price to the final buyer</li>
        <li>• send information to the customs authorities and the Ministry of Energy about non-compliance and take measures to eliminate any violations from occurring.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="aside__note" data-id="18">
      <p>As previously mentioned, LITASCO companies have implemented a whistle-blowing policy (available on the company’s intranet), providing an internal reporting channel in the case that an employee(s) has reason to suspect that an unlawful activity may have happened already or could potentially happen in the future.</p>
      <p>It would be extremely useful if everyone read, review and follow the principles of this policy</p>
      <p>If anyone is in the situation where they suspect any unlawful activity, you must escalate your concerns as soon as the incident occurs, in line with the corporate requirements.</p>
      <p>Every report will then be meticulously reviewed in line with compliance standards and will be treated with the utmost professionalism in line with corporate standards.</p>
